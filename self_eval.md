# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
> Syntax is confusing for hashes. It seems there is a new norm with not using double quotes to define keys and it means the documentation is a bit of a mess,

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
> It's going well! The colors are useful. I lost my green pen, I need to find it! The most useful notes are keywords which I've been writing in red. It makes it easy to quickly find a keyword I'm looking for. Everyone who has worked with me this week knows I'm reading my notes constantly.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
> I like to try things out first. A lot of times you can kinda guess at what you need and it might work. Then I go to google.
> I have always found I learn as much from my failures as from my successes.
